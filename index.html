	          		<h2>Hello!</h2>
	          		
	          		<p class="bio" style="text-align: left;">My name is James! I'm a company and non-profit Co-Founder, a Crypto and Blockchain enthusiast, an avid online learner, an Educator & Teaching Assistant, and an Associate at the NYU Media Lab. I began my development journey a few years ago when I took an Introduction to Programming course at NYU and never looked back. Since then I've been so excited to learn, make, and develop projects to test my skills to not only be industry ready, but also to truly understand programming, development and computer science. I also recently have become obsessed with blockchain technology (through Bitcoin and cryptocurrency) and the verification of information via consensus rules like Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake. </p>
	          		<p class="bio" style="text-align: left;"> I am a Co-Founder & Technical Director of the non-profit Future Of Humanity, which specializes in creating Social Impact Blockchain Hackathons to solve for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and connect winners and teams to organizations for funding and incubation. We work with corporate and public partners such as ConsenSys, Qtum, and the Slovenian Government to make sure that the best Social Impact Solutions don't die at the end of the Hackathon. We focus on making sure that ideas that can help others do not merely stay ideas. And the philosophy of distributed and transparent systems that allow not only for economic incentive for securing networks, but also to truly build systems that can empower others is in our eyes is one hopeful solution to a multitude of issues. From banking the 2 billion unbanked, to incentivizing decentralized clean energy production and building a new decentralized internet infrastructure, the possibilities are endless. It is also my goal to learn as much as I can about Blockchain Development to build my own distributed network infrastructures.</p>
	          		<p class="bio" style="text-align: left;">
	          			Everything I do I try to imbue with a playful blend of technical skills, creativity, and most importantly collaboration. As an educator and supporter of open-source projects, I believe that an ethos of open collaborative development and sharing is key in creating meaningful projects and products. As a Co-Founder, Tech Lead & Financial Director at SideWagon, I work with other creatives to build projects and campaigns for clients such as The New York Times, BMW, Apple, Samsung, LG, Beats by Dre., and Adidas that offer the perspective of genuine humanity. A student run, led, and founded organization that is now looking toward incorporation into an LLC, SideWagon is an effort that was born from a collective of young entrepreneurs and creatives working on shared passions.
