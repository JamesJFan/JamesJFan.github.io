                                   Hey there! I'm James Fan and I'm a Media, Culture, & Communications major at NYU. I was born in the US but spent a good time of my teenage years at an international school in China.

                              <p>
                                   Growing up was a cacophony of experience, and I learned a lot living in various places but I never really felt like I had a home. After coming to New York, even though I didn't like the city at first, I really carved out a place for myself that I feel I really belong. New York is home for me now.
                              </p>

                                        Yet as I found home in a tough city, I began to wonder what I really wanted to do with my life. I was like a jellyfish; spineless and without much direction. I love my major, that if for sure. But I have always felt it was a bit fluffy. The theory is great and I learn a lot, but wanted to go more technical. I took a digital media class and a programming course a year ago and found I really enjoyed web design and programming and wanted to continue going more indepth. I now have a double minor in Computer Science and Web Programming and Applications. I'm still not to sure what I am going to do, but I enjoy it a lot and think I'll just try and keep doing what I'm doing and figure it out from there.

                                        I currently am a Teaching Assistant for a Digital Media: Theory & Practice course in Steinhardt and am part of the MCC Media Lab.
