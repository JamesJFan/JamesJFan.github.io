  <h3>Narrative of Space</h3>
  <p><em></em></p>
  <p>Navigating my way through the glass cases surrounding much of the 3,500 pieces on display in the Quai Branly was a little confusing and  a little foreboding. I was never at ease in the space as claustrophobic cave-like rooms or the low hum of recorded religious chanting and loops of videos play in the nooks and crannies that dotted the side of the exhibition space creeped up on me. There is a lot to see, read, and observe as you walk through each of the four distinct continental sections that split up the permanent collection. Many of the pieces in these sections were not placed separate from each other, or given space to breathe or exist on their own. It was so densely packed, that one had to retrace a space multiple times to see the entirety of even one of the smaller sections. The organization of the exhibits themselves divide into four cultural regions, with Oceania and Africa being the largest collections. Generally there are several stylistic changes in materials or objects that tell visitors what section they have wandered into. Still, even though the space has a cavernous atmosphere, it is not very large. Even though the denseness of the placement of the objects makes the space seem bigger I walked end to end fairly quickly.</p> 
  <img class="talk" src="/images/map.jpg">
  <p>Yet even when walking slowly I would often still become confused as I accidently happened upon Moroccan clothing after I was looking at Vietnamese garments fairly recently. I could not tell where one culture began and another ended. Various outfits or artifacts dubbed ceremonial from different cultures were put next to each other in a hodge-podge of meaning. Even when you knew which section you were in, it was difficult to tell when and where each piece originated from. Time, space, and cultures were jumbled together in a pressing darkness that made the experience feel like exploring a jungle or cave. It seemed primal, primitive in nature, and with the very deliberate lighting it seemed like a theater production of other cultures. </p>
  <img class="talk" src="/images/armor.jpg">
  <p>In the African section there was small cave like exhibit space that houses rows of African "power statues" filled with rusty nails, strange faces, and undescribed significance. It seemed I was trespassing on in a land that was not my own, not only because of the claustrophobic and eerie design, but also because I really did not know what power statue was meant to convey. Were these symbols of spiritual protection? There were so many of them I assumed that they were used in a personal context as well. Are these objects meant to be displayed, and did their original creators or owners feel that they should? The main feeling I had was just one a pure disconnect. A disconnect from what exactly I was supposed to focus on. I tried to focus on its aesthetic qualities, but the space and the artifact itself kept reminding me that this was not my world, and I truly did not understand what was in front of me. How could I appreciate something I did not even know how to begin to understand?</p>

  <h3>Mediation of the Musée's History</h3>
  <p><em></em></p>
  <p>The purpose of an art museum is in general an appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of objects or artistic endeavors. Being a museum of Non-European art, it would seem natural for the Musée du quai Branly to accentuate the aesthetic qualities of its collection. In many ways, it inverts the artistic traditionalist views on what constitutes art and breaks with the perennial mediation on aesthetics and artistic value as being of primarily Western origin. Before plans for the museum had been established, this discourse on the diversity in aesthetic appreciation from was coursing through France as it tried to recognize equal value of diverse cultures within the Republic. The first ventures into exploring this topic were the exhibitions in the Louvre that showcased the pieces from various collections as the "first arts" or sometimes known as the more politically incorrect "primitive arts" (Ruiz-Gómez 418). It was then decided by the government of President Jacques Chirac to go ahead with building the Musée du quai Branly in 1998. From then to it's completion in 2006 a lot of thought, planning, and designing was done to showcase an "ambitious program of temporary exhibitions, dance, theatre and lectures [that] established fellowships to attract scholars and researchers from the cultures represented in the museum" (Ruiz-Gómez 426). France at this time was also acutely aware of various social tensions within the nation, as many people from foreign cultural backgrounds felt left out of the French Republic. The issue of the Banlieue, suburban areas that have traditionally been prone to poverty and riots, was in the collective national consciousness as the Musée du quai Branly opened soon after the infamous fall 2005 riots. As those who lived in the Banlieue, many of whom come from immigrant communities and are French citizens of foreign descent, ironically did not feel welcomed by France and its universal Republican values. </p>
  <img class="talk" src="/images/darkweb.jpg">
  <p>When the museum first opened it attracted large populations from these immigrant community in France as many saw that "the space celebrates the patrimonies of their cultures as art" (Brothers 1). Even the museum president and employees of the museum felt "that something is starting to shift in France" and that many of the visitors seemed to be young, of various backgrounds, and were visiting on their own initiative rather than with institutions or clubs (Brothers). One visitor from Senegal named Amadou Achard-Sy said, "It reminds me of my childhood in the countryside near the Senegal River — all the musical instruments, the clothes," and that "this museum, it’s the proof that this culture is being taken into account." (Brothers) Another visitor of Algerian descent said, “You see things from the Incas, from southern Africa, but we are not used to seeing things from the Maghreb in a museum” (Brothers) On top of this, it is a relatively popular museum with 14 million visitors in 10 years from its opening in 2006 to 2016 (AFP 1). It is these evidences that show the positive reactions, or at least the intense curiosity, that the Musée du quai Branly generated. The museum wanted to follow through on those universalist ideals, to show that traditional Western views on aesthetics are limited, and that artistic endeavors outside of the European tradition of art and thought are also beautiful. </p>
	<img class="talk" src="/images/origin.jpg">
   <p>These contextual mediations are important as they go into how the narrative of the space is interpreted. This interpretation is what drives the mediation of the space itself. Yet, interpretation is a fluid concept, even as we examine the affective invitations that a space can lend itself to, this does not mean it will be reliably examined or mediated in that way. For some the Musée is a testament to France recognizing their own, or just different, cultures in general. For others, it is a museum that glorifies the otherness of different cultures in a haphazard manner , where "old, new, good, bad are all jumbled together without much reason or explanation", that exploits a history of colonial seizure (Kimmelman 1). Though the design of the space itself contributes to the mediation of its narrative, to truly understand the Musée as a site its collection and pieces have to be connected to various debates on how to equally represent and recognize diversity of cultural backgrounds in France.

  <h3>Spectacle, Visibility, & Erasure</h3>
  <p><em></em></p>
    <p>It's difficult to say how the design of space and objects of cultural value can shape the mediation of narrative, but there are evidences that begin to show the underlying issue that shadows the debate between aesthetics and ethnography. That problem is what isn't on display in the exhibit rather than what is, and that changes how the Musée du quai Branly is interpreted. The entire conceptual debate in French government, not just about how the museum would be portrayed, is one that focuses on the marked problem of diversity. 
 We do not ask about this distinction when we walk into western art museums, their visibility is assumed. We get a little history in art museums, but never the whole contextual history of a piece because the story is implied. The context in which the West views western art is as part of the historical context which surrounds it. On top of this, most art in Western Museums were primarily made with aesthetics, display, and the notion of Western Art in mind, even the abstract pieces have to play with these rules. The Musée du quai Branly has, "far from accepting the possibility of alternative cultural expressions...tends somehow to limit the field of cultural diversity to one supposed universal form, the artistic one." (Dias 1) So then what happens when we try and appreciate only the aesthetic aspects of cultural objects not from a Western context? Even more so, what happens when a good portion of these objects weren't made for display or solely aesthetic appreciation to begin with? </p>
      <img class="talk" src="/images/river.jpg">
      <p>The museum can be seen as a sign in itself that these diverse cultures are, at a governmental level, beginning to be taken into account. For many that is a victory unto itself. Yet mediation of unity, "as it emerges in the spectacle, however, this contradiction is itself contradicted by virtue of a reversal of its meaning: division is presented as unity, and unity as division" (Debord 16). This account of diversity, and displaying that recognition, can mean providing a depth of understanding of difference, or it can contribute to the spectacle of it. The museum's spectacle "removes it from both the movements of historical time and changes of place" (Lebovics 104). The spectacularization of aesthetics forces us to questions what we see, "are these cultures we are viewing dead, changed, still creative, or just part of the swelling mixture of cultural flotsam and jetsam that defines our global era" (Lebovics)? </p>
     <img class="talk" src="/images/armor.jpg">
      <p>At some point the spectacle of the other becomes the erasure of the self. For example, the museum director Stéphane Martin said that the Quai Branly was a "neutral environment" with "no aesthetic or philosophical line" (Kimmelman). In trying to erase the lines between how we mediate the West and Non-European societies, the museum simplifies of the original contexts of these objects and artifacts. This erases both the history of the other, and ignores their own worldview and status as "unmarked" in the mediation of the collection. Even though Jacques Chirac, during the opening of the Branly commented "there is no hierarchy among the arts, and no hierarchy among peoples" (Dias 1) there seems to be a divide in how people end up interpreting that aim. And indeed, the museum's primary purposes were to "overcome the art/artefact distinction and to provide an innovative gaze on non-Western objects" and "to allow visitors to see freely without the lenses of knowledge formations deemed to restrain the ‘pure’ contemplation of the objects"(Dias). This neutrality in design and mediation, is theoretically a way to equally represent all cultures, but it is precisely the culture of neutrality that can dominate the collections in the Musée. As Natasha Ruiz-Gómez notes, "museums are not—nor can they be—neutral spaces," they have to be seen as "texts inflected and formed by ideologies" (Ruiz-Gómez 420).
The museum also chooses to put emphasis "on the equal value of artistic expressions is closely linked to the museum's aim to overcome the colonial past by promoting the works of the once colonised into the ranks of aesthetics" (Dias). This larger historical context of French Colonialism that has to be addressed as much of these collections were donated by French colonists, missionaries, explorers, and ethnographers. For many, especially the French government, the Musée du quai Branly seemed an atonement for a exploitative colonial history by placing these objects into the mainstream consciousness. Yet that elevation "in a sense reproduces the dynamics of colonialism, since Western standards control the flow of the mainstream and can bestow or withhold the label art" (Dias). </p>
      <img class="talk" src="/images/screen.jpg">
      <p>The pieces in these collections are given an equal platform, but nothing to say. Their voices are lost as they are ripped out of their context, space, and time. The collection of course lends itself to observation, to thought, and can even be the beginning of a deeper understanding of different cultures through this "innovative gaze". But at the same time the story that is told, is not told by the culture itself, but by the objectivism of the French Universalist approach to diversity. We are merely meant to be the watchers on the walls, the spectators to human culture, a third party observer that can examine the "truth" of objects because of our removal from the trappings of culture. I was briefly pulled out of this spectator status as I was forced to try to objectively observe my own culture. A culture I had spent much of my life immersed in. I began to realize that my own cultural background as an observer was tantamount to my relationship with the collection. I could not fully disassociate myself from my cultural lense as that also included me forgetting the significance of cultural objects like samurai armor that never is contextualized in its feudal or clan history, or Yao wedding gowns that do not explain more about one of the 56 ethnic groups that make up the state of China. I do not expect that this has to be explained, as some things will be lost in curation, but it is an example of how my cultural bias and lens lends itself to different a observational gaze. </p>

      <p>This same relationship between observer and artifact then also applies to the mediation of an observer of French or Western origin. The importance of cultural lenses to understand objects like African power statues, or Maori fishing nets, makes us realize that we never really can get away from them. For instance, a literal temple to French revolutionary culture and mystique sits in Paris in the form of the Pantheon. Furthermore, French law forbids radios from playing less than 40% of French music during the day, there is institute for the preservation of the official French language, and there is a law that defines what exactly should be in a traditional baguette. France is entrenched in the trappings of its culture, it is not something that is seen as superficial to the understanding of what constitutes France or its people. Presidents have campaigned by praising French agriculture and hugging goats, cultural values and symbols matter a lot in France. </p>

      <p>This is by no means a bad thing, it just is. However, if one wants to hold up French Universalism as the great uniter of humanity, then in some ways it can't be tied to Frenchness. The logic follows that either other cultures need to also become mediated as "unmarked" or the there has to be an acknowledgement of the erasure of French ethnocentrism. As long as every other culture is still marked as other or superficial to the uniting goal, and French culture isn't, it seems hard to truly have an equality between cultures. This doesn't even mean that France needs to forgo its culture, it merely is a recognition that French culture is as sociological and mythical as the narratives of the other cultures it tries to objectively observe. Otherwise, other cultures will be relegated to a less-than position, as French culture has become intertwined with the Universalist ideal. As Trouillet puts it when describing a sense of fragmented globality, "every time a français de souche (a white French citizen endowed with Frenchness since times immemorial) claims to have North African, black, or even Eastern European friends-and implicitly expects recognition for that deed-he also verifies his right to be both French-and therefore universal-yet open to diversity"(Trouillot 75). On the other hand however, this "claim further locks the 'friends' [who are not fraçais de souche] who become merely-at least for the moment -instances of Otherness and thus, by definition non-universal” (Trouillot). The recognition of diversity and difference in certain ways confine that diversity within an unequal marked status, that traditional French citizens may not be confined by. Through the  restrictive identities, "are imposed on others as the the reinforcement of such identities is the only durable result of such acts" (Trouillot). </p>

      <p>The idea of objectivism, and a universalism where culture is the superficial learned trappings of a common humanity, is a worldview in itself. It is difficult to hold up an Islamic prayer scroll from a different culture and time and convey the same depth of understanding to a French context, than say holding up a Bordeaux wine bottle. Many of these objects were never intended for this kind of display. That doesn't mean that they can't or shouldn't be displayed, but it does mean a lot of work needs to be done to actually shift one's perspective to see its significance in another context. </p> <br>
