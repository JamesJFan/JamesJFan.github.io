  <h3>Narrative of Space</h3>
  <p><em></em></p>
  <p>Navigating my way through the glass cases surrounding much of the 3,500 pieces on display in the Quai Branly was a little confusing and  a little foreboding. I was never at ease in the space as claustrophobic cave-like rooms or the low hum of recorded religious chanting and loops of videos play in the nooks and crannies that dotted the side of the exhibition space creeped up on me. There is a lot to see, read, and observe as you walk through each of the four distinct continental sections that split up the permanent collection. Many of the pieces in these sections were not placed separate from each other, or given space to breathe or exist on their own. It was so densely packed, that one had to retrace a space multiple times to see the entirety of even one of the smaller sections. The organization of the exhibits themselves divide into four cultural regions, with Oceania and Africa being the largest collections. Generally there are several stylistic changes in materials or objects that tell visitors what section they have wandered into. Still, even though the space has a cavernous atmosphere, it is not very large. Even though the denseness of the placement of the objects makes the space seem bigger I walked end to end fairly quickly.</p> 
<p>Yet even when walking slowly I would often still become confused as I accidently happened upon Moroccan clothing after I was looking at Vietnamese garments fairly recently. I could not tell where one culture began and another ended. Various outfits or artifacts dubbed ceremonial from different cultures were put next to each other in a hodge-podge of meaning. Even when you knew which section you were in, it was difficult to tell when and where each piece originated from. Time, space, and cultures were jumbled together in a pressing darkness that made the experience feel like exploring a jungle or cave. It seemed primal, primitive in nature, and with the very deliberate lighting it seemed like a theater production of other cultures. </p>
<p>In the African section there was small cave like exhibit space that houses rows of African "power statues"filled with rusty nails, strange faces, and undescribed significance. It seemed I was trespassing on in a land that was not my own, not only because of the claustrophobic and eerie design, but also because I really did not know what power statue was meant to convey. Were these symbols of spiritual protection? There were so many of them I assumed that they were used in a personal context as well. Are these objects meant to be displayed, and did their original creators or owners feel that they should? The main feeling I had was just one a pure disconnect. A disconnect from what exactly I was supposed to focus on. I tried to focus on its aesthetic qualities, but the space and the artifact itself kept reminding me that this was not my world, and I truly did not understand what was in front of me. How could I appreciate something I did not even know how to begin to understand?</p>
